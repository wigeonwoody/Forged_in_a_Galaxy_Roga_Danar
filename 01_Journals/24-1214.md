### SCENE 1 - Friend or Foe
- Setup:
    - Celebration in the Cantina.
    - Roga Danar has just been ordained to Jedi Knight.
    - He is celebrating with his four Clone Trooper compatriots in the cantina.


You are in the *The Rusty Rancor* cantina. It's a gritty, dimly lit establishment nestled in one of Coruscant's less glamorous districts. Known for its rough-and-tumble clientele, The Rusty Rancor is a favorite haunt for mercenaries, bounty hunters, and those who prefer to keep their business away from prying eyes. The air is thick with smoke and the scent of strong spirits, and the sound of raucous laughter and clinking glasses fills the room.

At a corner table, Roga Danar—sits with a group of Clone Troopers. Their white armor is stacked neatly beside them, and their faces are relaxed, a rare sight in these tumultuous times. They're celebrating Roga's recent ordainment as a Jedi Knight, a momentous occasion that calls for laughter and camaraderie.

The Clone Troopers, loyal and steadfast, raise their glasses in a toast. "To Roga, the bravest Jedi we've had the honor to serve with!" one of them exclaims, his voice carrying over the din of the cantina. The others cheer in agreement, their voices a chorus of admiration and respect.

Roga's Clone Trooper friends, who have been by his side through numerous battles, are:

1. **CT-7567 "Bolt"** - A seasoned leader with a strong sense of loyalty and duty. Bolt is known for his tactical acumen and unwavering support for his Jedi commanders.

2. **CT-1409 "Echo"** - Known for his resourcefulness and technical expertise, Echo has a knack for getting out of tight spots and is always ready with a quick-witted remark.

3. **CT-5555 "Fives"** - A brave and outspoken trooper, Fives is fiercely independent and often questions orders that don't sit right with him, always putting his brothers first.

4. **CT-6116 "Kix"** - The squad's medic, Kix is compassionate and dedicated to keeping his fellow troopers in fighting shape, often going above and beyond to ensure their safety.

These troopers have formed a tight-knit bond with Roga, sharing both the triumphs and trials of their service together.


As you rise from the table, the Clone Troopers cheer in agreement, raising their empty glasses in anticipation. The Rusty Rancor's floor creaks underfoot as you make your way to the bar, weaving through the crowd of patrons. The bartender, a grizzled old Rodian with a scar running across his snout, nods as you approach.

"Another round please" you say, leaning against the bar.

The Rodian grunts in acknowledgment, his large eyes glancing over at your table of Clone Troopers. "Coming right up," he replies in a gravelly voice, reaching for a row of mismatched mugs. As he begins to pour the drinks, you can't help but notice a group of shadowy figures in the corner of the cantina, their eyes occasionally flicking in your direction.

The Force whispers again, a subtle warning that something is amiss. The celebration feels like a fragile bubble, ready to burst at any moment.

As you wait for the drinks, your personal communicator buzzes insistently at your side. You retrieve it, the familiar device feeling suddenly heavy in your hand. The cantina's noise fades into the background as you answer the call, the small screen flickering to life with the image of Master Kael Zaryn.

His expression is grave, his voice urgent. "Roga, listen carefully. The Jedi are under attack. It's a coordinated strike—Order 66 has been issued. You must leave Coruscant immediately. Trust no one."

The weight of his words hits you like a blaster bolt. The celebration, the camaraderie, all of it shatters in an instant. Your mind races, the implications of the betrayal sinking in. The Clone Troopers, your friends, are now a potential threat.

Master Zaryn's image flickers, the connection unstable. "Find a way off-world. I'll try to contact you again when it's safe. May the Force be with you, Roga."

The call ends abruptly, leaving you standing at the bar, the drinks forgotten. You hear the sound of comlinks being answered and the voice of Emperor Palpatine.

Bolt's voice cuts through the din of the cantina like a blaster shot. "Commander, down!" he shouts, urgency and conflict evident in his tone. Instinct takes over as you dive to the floor, just as a blaster bolt sizzles past where you were standing moments before, scorching the bar's edge.

Kix hits Bolt's face with his blaster. Bolt stumbles backward, momentarily dazed. The other Clone Troopers, still under the influence of Order 66, turn their blasters on Roga with deadly intent.

Roga makes the Enter the Fray move.

You are in control.

I will interpret that as Del is able to react to the shout and get down and under cover.

Roga's Jedi reflexes kick in as he dodges the incoming blaster fire, his movements a blur as he leaps over the bar, seeking cover. The bartender, still crouched behind the bar, looks at Roga with wide eyes, clearly caught in the crossfire of a battle he never wanted to be part of.

The situation in The Rusty Rancor has escalated rapidly. As Kix's punch lands squarely on Bolt's face, Bolt stumbles backward, momentarily dazed. The other Clone Troopers, still under the influence of Order 66, turn their blasters on Roga with deadly intent.

"Stay down!" Roga warns the Rodian bartender, his voice urgent but calm. He peeks over the edge of the bar, assessing the situation. The Clone Troopers are advancing, their blasters trained on his position.

Roga takes a deep breath, centering himself in the Force. He knows he needs to act quickly to disarm his former friends without harming them. With a swift motion, he reaches out with the Force, sending a wave of energy towards the advancing troopers. The blast knocks them off balance, giving Roga a precious few seconds to plan his next move.

He glances at Bolt, who is struggling to regain his footing after Kix's punch. Roga knows that Blot is his best chance at breaking through the programming of Order 66. If he can reach Bolt, perhaps he can turn the tide of this confrontation.

"Bolt!" Roga calls out, his voice carrying over the chaos. "Fight it! Remember who you are!"

Bolt shakes his head, trying to clear the fog of the programming. His eyes meet Roga's, and for a moment, there's a flicker of recognition. But the other troopers are recovering, their blasters once again trained on Roga's position.

Roga knows he can't stay behind the bar for long. He needs to find a way to escape the cantina and regroup. The Force whispers to him, guiding his actions as he formulates a plan.

With a determined look, Roga ignites his lightsaber once more, the blue blade casting a glow over the dimly lit bar. He takes a deep breath, ready to make his move. The path ahead is uncertain, but he knows he must trust in the Force and his own instincts to survive this ordeal.

> Roga is hiding behind the bar. Roga focus with the Force and hits Echo, Fives, and Kix. They are knocked down. Bolt is still on the floor yelling at his friends to stop. Roga needs to get out of here. 

Roga takes a moment to steady his breathing, feeling the Force flow through him as he focuses on the immediate threat. With a swift, concentrated effort, he sends a powerful wave of Force energy towards Echo, Fives, and Kix. The impact knocks them off their feet, sending them sprawling across the cantina floor.

Bolt, still on the floor from earlier, is shouting at his friends, his voice filled with desperation. "Stop! This isn't right! Remember who we are!"

Roga knows this is his chance. With the troopers momentarily incapacitated, he has a brief window to make his escape. He glances at the bartender, who is still cowering behind the bar, and gives him a reassuring nod. "Stay safe," Roga says, his voice calm but urgent.

With a quick leap, Roga vaults over the bar, landing lightly on his feet. He keeps his lightsaber ignited, ready to deflect any incoming blaster fire as he makes his way toward the cantina's exit.

The patrons who haven't already fled are watching in stunned silence, some peering out from behind overturned tables and chairs. The chaos of the cantina is a stark contrast to the calm determination Roga feels as he moves with purpose.

As he reaches the door, Roga spares a final glance back at his friends, hoping that Bolt's words might reach them. He knows that the bonds they've shared can't be easily broken, even by something as insidious as Order 66.

With a deep breath, Roga steps out into the bustling streets of Coruscant. The city is alive with the sounds of sirens and distant explosions, a testament to the chaos unfolding across the galaxy. He knows he needs to find a way off-world, to regroup and figure out his next steps.

End the Scene. 

Scene was out of control. Chaos goes up.

Chaos raised to __6__.


***

> We are starting a new scene. This one will be based on the rpg front  [[01 Escape from the Core#**Scene 1 The Hunt Begins**]]. Use the rpg front to generate the new scene. Roga has just escaped a fire fight with his friends Echo, Fives, and Kix. He doesn't know what's going on or why his friends tried to kill him. 

### SCENE 2 - The Hunt Begins
 

> [!NOTE]- The Hunt Begins
>  ![[01 Escape from the Core#**Scene 1 The Hunt Begins**]]

**Setup:**
- Roga Danar has just escaped the cantina after a firefight with his Clone Trooper friends, Echo, Fives, and Kix. Confused and on high alert, he steps into the bustling streets of Coruscant, unsure of why his allies turned against him.
- The city is in chaos, with sirens blaring and distant explosions echoing through the air. The once vibrant and bustling metropolis now feels like a war zone.
- Roga needs to find a way off-world, but first, he must navigate the dangers of Coruscant and avoid detection by any forces loyal to the new regime.

---
As you step out of The Rusty Rancor, the chaos of Coruscant envelops you. The streets are alive with panic, civilians rushing in every direction as the distant sounds of explosions and sirens fill the air. Overhead, Republic gunships patrol the skies, their searchlights cutting through the darkness. The once vibrant city now feels like a war zone, and you know you must stay alert.

Amidst the confusion, you spot a familiar face in the crowd—a Twi'lek named Lira, an informant who has aided you in the past. She catches your eye and gestures subtly toward a nearby alleyway, indicating she has something important to share. Her presence is a beacon of hope in the midst of the turmoil.

In the dimly lit alley, Lira waits, her expression tense. "Roga," she says urgently, "the Jedi are being hunted. You need to leave Coruscant immediately." She glances around, ensuring no one is listening. "There's a smuggler named Jax who owes me a favor. His ship is docked in the lower levels. I can help you reach him, but we must hurry." Her words underscore the urgency of your situation, and the path ahead is fraught with danger. 

What will you do next?

> GM- Give me a character description for Lira.

Certainly! Here's a character description for Lira:

**Lira** is a Twi'lek with striking azure skin and a pair of gracefully curved lekku that drape over her shoulders. Her eyes are a vibrant shade of green, sharp and perceptive, reflecting her keen intelligence and resourcefulness. Lira is dressed in practical, nondescript clothing that allows her to blend into the bustling crowds of Coruscant with ease. Her demeanor is calm and composed, even in the face of danger, a testament to her experience navigating the underworld of the galaxy's capital.

Lira has a reputation as a reliable informant, known for her ability to gather and relay information discreetly. Her network of contacts spans various sectors of Coruscant, making her an invaluable ally to those who earn her trust. Despite her connections to the criminal underworld, Lira has a strong moral compass and often uses her skills to aid those in need, especially during times of crisis. Her loyalty to Roga stems from past encounters where they have helped each other out of tight situations, forging a bond of mutual respect and trust.

> I want to know if she has an ulterior motive? I make the Gather Information move and roll a weak hit. I can't tell if Lira is truthful. However, a stormtrooper patrol is spotted coming towards me.

> ### Result: ![[outcome-miss.svg|50]] Miss

---

As you focus on Lira, trying to discern her true intentions, the Force offers you only a murky sense of her motives. Her expression remains earnest, and her words seem genuine, but there's an undercurrent of tension that you can't quite place. Whether it's the urgency of the situation or something more, you're left uncertain about her true intentions.

Before you can probe further, the sound of marching boots echoes down the alleyway. A patrol of stormtroopers is approaching, their white armor gleaming under the dim streetlights. Their presence is a stark reminder of the danger you're in, and you know you need to act quickly to avoid detection.

Lira's eyes widen as she notices the patrol, and she gestures for you to follow her deeper into the alley. "We need to move," she whispers urgently, her voice barely audible over the clatter of the stormtroopers' approach. The narrow passage offers a potential escape route, but you'll need to decide quickly whether to trust Lira and follow her lead or find another way to evade the patrol. What will you do next?

> Do the storm trooper spot us? Yes, but they have to push their way through a group of beings. We need to get out of here. I use the Force and hide myself from people's perceptions. I use the [[Force_Shroud]] ability and roll a strong hit. It's not so much hiding, but more like others just don't pay attention to me. I decide to trust Lira and follow her. We try to escape from the stormtroopers by getting lost in the crowd. I make the Face Danger move and roll a strong hit. We make it out of the alleyway and into the crowd. The stormtroopers loose sight of me and Lira. We head down another alleyway.

As the stormtroopers push their way through the throng of beings in the alley, you draw upon the Force, activating your Force Shroud ability. The world around you seems to shift subtly, and you feel a veil of perception fall over you. It's not invisibility, but rather a gentle nudge in the minds of those around you, encouraging them to overlook your presence.

With a strong hit on your Face Danger move, you and Lira slip seamlessly into the bustling crowd, your forms blending into the sea of beings moving through the streets of Coruscant. The stormtroopers, momentarily disoriented by the press of bodies and the subtle influence of the Force, lose sight of you and Lira as you make your way out of the alley.

Trusting Lira's guidance, you follow her through the maze of streets and alleyways, each turn taking you further from the patrol. The noise of the city envelops you, providing a comforting cover as you navigate the chaos. Eventually, you find yourselves in a quieter alley, the sounds of the stormtroopers now distant. Lira pauses, catching her breath, and looks at you with a mix of relief and urgency. "We should be safe for now," she says, her voice low. "But we need to keep moving if we're going to reach Jax and get you off-world." 

What will you do next?

>"Lira, tell me about this Jax. Who is he?"

Lira glances around the alley, ensuring you're still alone, before turning her attention back to you. "Jax is a smuggler," she explains, her voice steady but quick. "He's been running goods in and out of Coruscant for years. Not exactly the most reputable character, but he's reliable when it comes to getting people where they need to go—especially when those people don't want to be found."

She pauses, considering her words carefully. "He owes me a favor from a while back. I helped him out of a tight spot with some local authorities. He's got a ship docked in the lower levels, and if anyone can get you off this planet without drawing attention, it's him."

Lira's eyes meet yours, her expression earnest. "I know it's a risk, but right now, he's your best shot at getting out of here. The Empire's reach is growing by the minute, and staying on Coruscant isn't safe for you anymore." Her words carry a weight of urgency, underscoring the precariousness of your situation. What will you do next?

> First thing first, we need to find a place to stop and get me some different clothing. My Jedi robes will draw too much attention. We're going to have to get clothes or a disguise from somewhere or someone. I make the Secure an Advantage move and roll a weak hit.

---

With the urgency of your situation in mind, you and Lira set off through the winding alleyways, searching for a place where you can acquire a change of clothes. Your Jedi robes, though a symbol of your identity and purpose, are now a liability, drawing unwanted attention in a city where the Jedi are being hunted.

As you navigate the bustling streets, you spot a small vendor stall tucked away in a quieter corner of the district. The stall is run by a grizzled old human, his wares a haphazard collection of clothing and accessories. You approach cautiously, scanning the area for any signs of danger.

On a weak hit with your Secure an Advantage move, you manage to find a simple set of civilian clothes—a nondescript tunic and trousers that will help you blend in with the crowd. However, the vendor eyes you suspiciously, sensing your urgency. "These aren't cheap," he grumbles, his gaze flicking between you and Lira. You'll need to part with some credits to secure the disguise, but it will be worth it to move through the city unnoticed. What will you do next?


> I throw some credits down for the clothes. I use the Force and try and lightly Compel the vendor to forget us. Because I don't have the influence skill, I take a -1 penalty to the roll. I make the Compel move and rolled a miss with a match.

> ### Result: ![[outcome-miss.svg|50]] Miss with a MATCH!



---

As you attempt to subtly influence the vendor's mind with the Force, you feel a sudden resistance, as if the Force itself is pushing back against your efforts. The vendor's eyes widen, and he seems to shake off the influence you tried to exert. 

"Hey, what are you trying to pull?" he snaps, his voice rising in suspicion. His gaze darts around, and you notice a couple of nearby patrons turning their heads in your direction, drawn by the commotion.

The match on your miss indicates that something unexpected and potentially dangerous is about to unfold. The vendor, now on high alert, reaches for a hidden comlink beneath his counter, ready to call for security or worse, alert the authorities.

Lira tugs at your sleeve, her expression urgent. "We need to go, now!" she whispers, her voice barely audible over the vendor's protests.

The situation has escalated, and you must act quickly to avoid drawing further attention. What will you do next?

> "You want them or not?" I say to the vendor. "You're choice."

The vendor hesitates, his hand hovering over the comlink as he weighs your words. The credits you've offered are tempting, and the urgency in your voice suggests that you won't linger if he decides to make a scene. 

After a tense moment, he grumbles under his breath and snatches the credits from the counter. "Fine, take them," he mutters, his eyes still wary but no longer hostile. "But you better not cause any trouble around here."

With the transaction complete, you and Lira quickly move away from the stall, blending back into the flow of the crowd. The vendor's attention shifts back to his other customers, and the nearby patrons lose interest, allowing you to slip away without further incident.

Lira leads you through a series of winding alleyways, her pace quick and purposeful. "That was close," she says, glancing over her shoulder to ensure you're not being followed. "We need to keep moving. Jax's ship isn't far, but we can't afford any more delays."

The streets of Coruscant are still alive with chaos, but your new attire helps you blend in, reducing the risk of being recognized. As you navigate the labyrinthine paths of the city, you know that reaching Jax and securing passage off-world is your top priority.

What will you do next?

---

As you approach the checkpoint, you see stormtroopers stationed at strategic points, their blasters ready and their eyes scanning the crowd for any signs of trouble. The area is tightly controlled, and getting through without drawing attention will be a challenge.

You take a moment to survey the surroundings, looking for any potential routes that might allow you to bypass the checkpoint. On a weak hit with your Gather Information move, you notice a few possibilities:

1. **Service Tunnels:** To your left, there's a maintenance entrance partially obscured by a stack of crates. It appears to lead into a network of service tunnels that run beneath the city streets. These tunnels could provide a way around the checkpoint, but they are likely dark and potentially hazardous.

2. **Crowded Market:** To your right, a bustling market is in full swing, with vendors and shoppers creating a dense throng of activity. If you can blend into the crowd, you might be able to slip past the checkpoint unnoticed, though it will require careful navigation to avoid being spotted.

3. **Roof Access:** Above you, a series of interconnected rooftops offer a potential path over the checkpoint. However, reaching them would require some climbing, and there's a risk of being seen if you're not careful.

Each option carries its own risks and rewards, and you'll need to decide which path to take. Lira looks to you for guidance, ready to follow your lead. What will you do next?

> We need to get around the checkpoint. I focus the Force and attempt another [[Force_Shroud]]. We're going to sneak through the market. I make the Face Danger move and roll a strong hit.

---

Drawing upon the Force, you activate your Force Shroud ability once more, feeling the familiar veil of perception settle over you and Lira. The bustling market becomes your ally, its chaotic energy providing the perfect cover as you move through the throng of vendors and shoppers.

With a strong hit on your Face Danger move, you navigate the crowded market with ease, your presence cloaked from the watchful eyes of the stormtroopers. The Force guides your steps, allowing you to slip past the checkpoint unnoticed, your movements fluid and unremarkable amidst the sea of beings.

Lira stays close by your side, her confidence bolstered by your mastery of the Force. Together, you weave through the market, avoiding any potential obstacles and keeping a low profile. The stormtroopers remain focused on the checkpoint, oblivious to your passage.

As you emerge on the other side of the market, the sounds of the checkpoint fade into the background, replaced by the hum of the city around you. You've successfully bypassed the stormtroopers, and the path to Jax's ship is now clear.

Lira glances at you, a hint of admiration in her eyes. "That was impressive," she says, her voice low. "We're almost there. Jax's ship is just a few blocks away."

With the checkpoint behind you, the urgency of your mission remains. What will you do next?
