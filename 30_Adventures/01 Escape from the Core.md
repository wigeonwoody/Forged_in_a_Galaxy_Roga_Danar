### **How to Play This Solo**

- **Random Encounters:** Use dice rolls or card draws to determine whether events escalate or if new dangers emerge.
- **Resource Management:** Track items like credits, food, and equipment, forcing the player to make sacrifices or take risks.
- **Countdown Mechanics:** Advance the countdown in each scene whenever the player fails a key action, takes too long, or triggers an Imperial response.
- **Branching Outcomes:** Success or failure in one scene impacts subsequent scenes (e.g., escaping the starport without stealing a ship might lead to being stranded later).
