### **How to Play This Solo**

- **Emergent Conflicts:** Use dice or cards to determine random events. For example:
    - Roll to detect sabotage before it escalates (e.g., "On a roll of 4-6, you find a clue. On 1-3, you face another danger.")
    - Introduce variable hazards in the asteroid field (e.g., "Is there a large asteroid blocking the path?").
- **Countdown Mechanic:** Advance the countdown whenever the player takes too long, fails to act, or triggers an Imperial response.
- **Resource Management:** Track limited resources like fuel, munitions, or manpower, forcing tough decisions during the escape.
