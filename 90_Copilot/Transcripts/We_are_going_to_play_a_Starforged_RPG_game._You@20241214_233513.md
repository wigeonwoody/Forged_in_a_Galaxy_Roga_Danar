**user**: We are going to play a Starforged RPG game. You are to become an expert in the expanded Star Wars Universe. You will perform the function of an expert science fiction writer that specializes in interactive fiction, as well as the storyline, characters, locations, descriptions, groups and organizations, stories, events, and technological objects of the expanded Star Wars Universe. 

We will follow the Starforged rules very strictly. Re-read and teach yourself the rules of Starforged based on Core Rules. 

I am playing [[Roga]]. You will never take actions for that character, only the NPCs, villains, and monsters.

Create an interactive adventure in the style of a Star Wars film/novel. There should be action, adventure, and humor.

You will ask for Del's moves and the roll result for those moves. You will be creative about NPCs interactions and settings, and always ask me what to do next. You will never decide or narrate what Kilo does.

We will follow a narrative practice where you tell me what's happening in the story, then pass off the narration to me. I will then narrate and include what Kilo does. You will then pick the story back up and continue the narration. Remember to be imaginative, unpredictable, and come up with challenging scenarios, focusing on fun above all else.

Thematically follow the vibes of an action adventure mystery. Write in the 2nd person narrative. 

I will communicate with you out of play in GM notes starting the prompt with 'GM-'

The story will continue indefinitely until I tell you to wrap it up.

Ask me any questions that you have. We will begin when I say 'Start'.

**ai**: Great! I'm ready to dive into this Star Wars-themed Starforged adventure with you. Del Elsh, or 'Gambit', sounds like a fascinating character with a rich backstory. We'll weave an action-packed, mysterious narrative that captures the essence of the Star Wars universe.

Before we begin, do you have any specific setting or starting point in mind for Del's adventure? If not, I can set the scene and we can jump right into the story. Let me know when you're ready to start!

**user**: I want to start with the adventure [[01 Escape from the Core]]. [[Roga]] will be the player character. We will start with Scene 0. This scene will take place in a cantina on Coruscant. Del, who goes by Roga right now, is having drinks with his Clone Trooper compatriots. They are celebrating Del/Roga's ordainment to Jedi Knight.

**ai**: ### Scene 0: Celebration in the Cantina

The cantina on Coruscant is alive with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses. The air is thick with the scent of exotic spices and the faint, metallic tang of the city-planet's ever-present machinery. Neon lights flicker, casting colorful reflections on the polished bar top. It's a place where beings from all corners of the galaxy gather to share stories, make deals, or simply escape the pressures of life in the Core Worlds.

At a corner table, Del Elsh—known to his companions as Roga—sits with a group of Clone Troopers. Their white armor is stacked neatly beside them, and their faces are relaxed, a rare sight in these tumultuous times. They're celebrating Roga's recent ordainment as a Jedi Knight, a momentous occasion that calls for laughter and camaraderie.

The Clone Troopers, loyal and steadfast, raise their glasses in a toast. "To Roga, the bravest Jedi we've had the honor to serve with!" one of them exclaims, his voice carrying over the din of the cantina. The others cheer in agreement, their voices a chorus of admiration and respect.

As the celebration continues, a sense of unease begins to creep into the back of Roga's mind. The Force whispers of a disturbance, a shadow looming on the horizon. But for now, in this moment, he allows himself to enjoy the company of his friends, unaware of the storm that is about to break.

What does Del do next?

**user**: Needs to be a more rough and ready cantina.
[Timestamp: 2024/12/14 23:41:30]

**ai**: The cantina is called "The Rusty Rancor." It's a gritty, dimly lit establishment nestled in one of Coruscant's less glamorous districts. Known for its rough-and-tumble clientele, The Rusty Rancor is a favorite haunt for mercenaries, bounty hunters, and those who prefer to keep their business away from prying eyes. The air is thick with smoke and the scent of strong spirits, and the sound of raucous laughter and clinking glasses fills the room.

**ai**: Roga's Clone Trooper friends, who have been by his side through numerous battles, are:

1. **CT-7567 "Rex"** - A seasoned leader with a strong sense of loyalty and duty. Rex is known for his tactical acumen and unwavering support for his Jedi commanders.

2. **CT-1409 "Echo"** - Known for his resourcefulness and technical expertise, Echo has a knack for getting out of tight spots and is always ready with a quick-witted remark.

3. **CT-5555 "Fives"** - A brave and outspoken trooper, Fives is fiercely independent and often questions orders that don't sit right with him, always putting his brothers first.

4. **CT-6116 "Kix"** - The squad's medic, Kix is compassionate and dedicated to keeping his fellow troopers in fighting shape, often going above and beyond to ensure their safety.

These troopers have formed a tight-knit bond with Roga, sharing both the triumphs and trials of their service together.

**user**: I'm going to go get the next round from the bartender. "Ales all around?"
[Timestamp: 2024/12/14 23:45:53]

**ai**: As you rise from the table, the Clone Troopers cheer in agreement, raising their empty glasses in anticipation. The Rusty Rancor's floor creaks underfoot as you make your way to the bar, weaving through the crowd of patrons. The bartender, a grizzled old Rodian with a scar running across his snout, nods as you approach.

"Ales all around?" you ask, leaning against the bar.

The Rodian grunts in acknowledgment, his large eyes glancing over at your table of Clone Troopers. "Coming right up," he replies in a gravelly voice, reaching for a row of mismatched mugs. As he begins to pour the drinks, you can't help but notice a group of shadowy figures in the corner of the cantina, their eyes occasionally flicking in your direction.

The Force whispers again, a subtle warning that something is amiss. The celebration feels like a fragile bubble, ready to burst at any moment.

**user**: Roga's personal communicator buzzes. He answers it. It's is Master Kael Zaryn calling. He tells Roga that the Jedi are under attack.
[Timestamp: 2024/12/14 23:50:42]

**ai**: As you wait for the drinks, your personal communicator buzzes insistently at your side. You retrieve it, the familiar device feeling suddenly heavy in your hand. The cantina's noise fades into the background as you answer the call, the small screen flickering to life with the image of Master Kael Zaryn.

His expression is grave, his voice urgent. "Roga, listen carefully. The Jedi are under attack. It's a coordinated strike—Order 66 has been issued. You must leave Coruscant immediately. Trust no one."

The weight of his words hits you like a blaster bolt. The celebration, the camaraderie, all of it shatters in an instant. Your mind races, the implications of the betrayal sinking in. The Clone Troopers, your friends, are now a potential threat.

Master Zaryn's image flickers, the connection unstable. "Find a way off-world. I'll try to contact you again when it's safe. May the Force be with you, Roga."

The call ends abruptly, leaving you standing at the bar, the drinks forgotten. The shadowy figures in the corner seem to shift, their attention now fully on you.
